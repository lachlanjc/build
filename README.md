## Background

During a site build, there are a variety of things happening under the hood.

This is a simplified view of a typical build life cycle:

1. Netlify clones your repo & looks for diffs
2. Dependencies are install in the project
3. We run your build command
4. Files & dependencies are cached
5. Finally, your site is deployed to the web!

Historically, when connecting your site to Netlify, we ask for the build command (step 3 above) and will run through
this process. This works great for most use cases & will continue to do so 😃

For builds that require a little more flexibility, we are introducing a programatic interface on top of these build
events to allow users to customize this flow.

**Netlify Build** is designed to support any kind of build flow and is extendable to fit any unique project
requirements.

## How it works

Builds are controlled by a series of [lifecycle](#lifecycle) events that `plugins` and configuration hook into.

**The [build lifecycle](#lifecycle) can be extended in two ways:**

1. Adding lifecycle commands to `build.lifecycle` in your [config file](#extending-via-config)
2. Installing pre-packaged [plugins](#plugins)

### 1. Extending via config

Inside the netlify config file, you can attach [lifecycle](#lifecycle) commands to a new property `build.lifecycle`.

```yml
build:
  publish: my-dist-folder
  # Run this lifecycle during build
  lifecycle:
    onInit:
      - npm run thing
      - echo "much wow"
    onPreBuild: curl download-static-content
    onBuild: npm run build
    onPostBuild:
      - npx generate-sitemap
```

### 2. Extending via plugins

[Netlify Plugins](#plugins) are installable packages that extend the functionality of the netlify build process.

They can be installed from `npm` or run locally from relative path in your project.

```yml
# Config file `plugins` defines plugins used by build.
plugins:
  - package: ./local/path/to/plugin-folder
    config:
      optionOne: 'hello'
      optionTwo: 'there'
 - package: plugin-from-npm
   config:
     optionOne: 'neat'
     arrayOfValues:
      - david@netlify.com
      - jim@netlify.com
```

Netlify plugins can be found on npm by
[searching for `keywords:netlify-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Anetlify-plugin).

## Lifecycle

The build process runs through a series of lifecycle events. These events are the places we can extend how the Netlify
build operates.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (LIFECYCLE_TABLE) -->
| Event          | Description |
|:------|:-------|
| ⇩ ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎ **<a href="#lifecycleoninit">onInit</a>** ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  | Runs before anything else |
| ⇩ ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎ **<a href="#lifecycleonprebuild">onPreBuild</a>** ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  | Before build commands are executed |
| ⇩ ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎ **<a href="#lifecycleonbuild">onBuild</a>** ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  | Build commands are executed |
| ⇩ ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎ **<a href="#lifecycleonpostbuild">onPostBuild</a>** ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  | After Build commands are executed |
| ⇩ ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎ **<a href="#lifecycleonsuccess">onSuccess</a>** ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  | Runs on build success |
| ⇩ ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎ **<a href="#lifecycleonerror">onError</a>** ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  | Runs on build error |
| 🎉 ‏‏‎ **<a href="#lifecycleonend">onEnd</a>** ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  ‏‏‎  | Runs on build error or success |
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END (LIFECYCLE_TABLE) -->

The Lifecycle flows the events in order and executes and their `onPre` & `onPost` counterparts.

`onPre` happens before a specific event.

`onPost` happens after a specific event.

```
      ┌───────────────┬────────────────┬──────────────────┐
      │     onPre     │     event      │      onPost      │

## Configuration

Configuration can be written in `toml`, `yml`, `json`, or `json5`.

**Example:**

```yml
# Config file `plugins` defines plugins used by build. Plugins are optional
plugins:
  - package: ./local/path/to/plugin-folder
    config:
      optionOne: 'hello'
      optionTwo: 'there'
  - package: plugin-from-npm
    config:
      optionOne: 'neat'
      arrayOfValues:
        - david@netlify.com
        - jim@netlify.com

# Inline `build.lifecycle` commands can be defined
build:
  lifecycle:
    onInit:
      - npm run foo
      - export VALUE=lol
      - echo "much wow"
    onGetCache:
      - echo 'curl custom cache'
    onPreBuild: echo "${env:privateKey}"
    onBuild: |
      echo 'Hello Netlify Build!'
      npm run build
```

Configuration now supports `environment` variables.

To reference an environment variable in Netlify config:

```yml
foo: ${env:MY_ENV_VAR}
```

## Plugins

Netlify Plugins extend the functionality of the netlify build process.

Plugins are plain JavaScript objects with event handlers for the different events happening during builds.

For example, the `onPreBuild` event handler runs before your build command. Or the `onPostBuild` event handler runs
after your site build has completed.

Here is an example:

```js
// ./node_modules/netlify-plugin-awesome/index.js

module.exports = {
  name: 'netlify-plugin-awesome',
  onInit: () => {
    console.log('Run custom logic at beginning of build')
  },
  onPreBuild: () => {
    console.log('Run custom logic before build happens')
  },
  onPostBuild: () => {
    console.log('Run custom logic after build happens')
  },
  onEnd: () => {
    console.log('Run custom logic at the end of the build')
  },
}
```

To use this plugin, define the `plugins` key in your Netlify config file.

```yml
build:
  functions: src/functions
  publish: build
  command: npm run build

# Netlify build plugins
plugins:
  # Path to plugin. Can be local relative path or reference to node_modules
  - package: netlify-plugin-awesome
    config:
      foo: hello
      bar: goodbye
```

### What can plugins do?

Plugins can do a-lot and we are excited what the JAMstack community will build!

**Here are some examples:**

- **@netlify/plugin-lighthouse** to automatically track your lighthouse site score between deployments
- **@netlify/plugin-sitemap** to generate sitemaps after build
- **@netlify/plugin-notify** to automatically wired up build notifications
- **@netlify/plugin-no-more-404** fail build or warn if prior .html files disappear without corresponding Netlify
  redirects.
- **@netlify/plugin-axe** to automatically audit site for accessibility issues
- **@netlify/plugin-encrypted-files** to encrypt files in source, but to decrypt them locally and for the build, so that
  you can do _partial_ open source sites without leaking announcements or private info.
- **@netlify/plugin-twiliosms** text your boss every time you deploy so they know you're working -
  [example guide here in Creating and using your first Netlify Build Plugin](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/10/16/creating-and-using-your-first-netlify-build-plugin/)
- **@netlify/plugin-svgoptimizer** to automatically optimize all SVGs in a directory when the site is built
- **netlify-plugin-cypress** to automatically run integration tests
- **netlify-plugin-tweet-new-post** to automatically share new content via twitter on new publish
- ... the sky is the limit 🌈

## CLI commands

Like [Netlify dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/), Netlify build runs locally and in the remote CI context

To execute your build locally, run the following CLI command:

```
netlify build
```

It's also possible to "try before you buy" and test out the build flow before executing any code with the `dry` run
flag.

The `--dry` flag will output everything that happens in the build flow without executing the plugin event handlers.

To execute a test run of the build locally, run the following CLI command:

```
netlify build --dry
```
